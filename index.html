                        The goal of this COVID-19 mapping project is to put COVID in its spatial and social context, to
                        allow
                        better exploration and understanding of geographic patterning in detected cases and deaths. We
                        will
                        also
                        explore how the distribution of COVID-19 cases change with respect to social risk factors, such
                        as
                        urban/rural environment, age and race. We have developed this interactive map for you to
                        physically
                        explore the spread of COVID-19 cases around the state of Michigan through space and time, from
                        the
                        first
                        detected case on March 8th until May 3rd.

                    <p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 525px;">
                        COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets, according to the
                        WHO,
                        refers
                        to
                        droplets >5-10 μm (micrometers) in diameter. Transmission by respiratory droplets typically
                        requires
                        close
                        contact between individuals. The WHO defines such contact as within about 1 meter (approximately
                        3
                        feet)
                        of
                        someone experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing or sneezing. However, transmission can
                        also
                        occur
                        through droplets on surfaces, and if someone touches that surface and then touches their
                        eyes/mouth/nose,
                        the virus can spread.

                    <h3>Where are we getting these numbers?</h3>
                    <p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 525px;">
                        These data come from the <a style="color:steelblue;"
                            href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/">Michigan
                            Department of Health and
                            Human Services</a>
                        and reflect daily counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Michigan. As a
                        result, this specifically reflects risk among those who are being tested in the state of
                        Michigan.
                        Information on testing in Michigan is available at the <a style="color: steelblue"
                            href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173_99225---,00.html">Michigan.gov
                            coronavirus page</a>.
                        However, it is
                        important to keep in mind that the numbers on the map here reflect not the total number of
                        COVID-19
                        infections, but confirmed cases who are being tested. Specific criteria are required in order to
                        be
                        tested, and this has changed over time. The percent positive rate is a good way to contextualize
                        how
                        many of the ‘true’ cases are being captured. The cumulative percent positive rate <a
                            style="color: steelblue"
                            href="https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173_99225---,00.html">is
                            about
                            25%</a>
                        in the state of Michigan, meaning that on average, for every case detected by a COVID-19 test,
                        there are
                        three
                        negative tests. This high rate of positives indicates we are likely missing a good portion of
                        the true
                        extent of cases, indicating that risk estimates on this map are conservative.

                <h3>What can we learn from mapping COVID-19?</h3>
                <h6 style="color: gray; opacity: 0.75;">Importance of social distancing</h6>
                <p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 525px;">
                    This droplet-based transmission is why wearing masks, washing your hands carefully, and maintaining
                    6 feet
                    of distance whenever possible can help to stem the spread of coronavirus. Additionally, droplet
                    transmission
                    indicates that individuals need to be close to one another in physical space to spread the virus.
                    This means
                    that someone’s risk of infection is strongly influenced by local rates of infection in their
                    surroundings,
                    making a map of local disease incidence potentially helpful for understanding infection risks in
                    your area.
                </p>
                <h6 style="color: gray; opacity: 0.75;">Locating risk areas</h6>
                <p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 525px;">
                    However, we have learned that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not the only factor driving
                    transmission
                    in Michigan and other U.S. states. For example, areas with more elderly individuals may be at higher
                    risk of
                    having cases of severe disease and death. Places with higher rates of poverty, unstable housing, and
                    pre-existing medical conditions have also seen increased risk.
                </p>
                <h6 style="color: gray; opacity: 0.75;">Estimating infection</h6>
                <p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 525px;">
                    Finally, our map currently includes only <b>reported</b> cases, and necessarily represents an
                    underestimate
                    of the
                    amount of infection that has and continues to occur. This is due to the fact that many cases may be
                    fully
                    asymptomatic, and that some individuals with mild symptoms of COVID-19 may not seek medical
                    attention. These
                    effects may vary in space, and these maps should be viewed with these limitations in mind.
